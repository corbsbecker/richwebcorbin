						   		Defeasible reasoning is a kind of reasoning that is based on reasons that are 
						   		defeasible, as opposed to the indefeasible reasons of deductive logic. 
						   		Defeasible reasoning is a particular kind of<br>
						   		non-demonstrative reasoning, where the reasoning does not produce a full, 
						   		complete, or final demonstration of a claim, i.e., where fallibility and 
						   		corrigibility of a conclusion are acknowledged. In<br>
						  		other words defeasible reasoning produces a contingent statement or claim. 
						  		Other kinds of non-demonstrative reasoning are probabilistic reasoning, 
						  		inductive reasoning, statistical reasoning, abductive reasoning,<br>
						   		and paraconsistent reasoning. Defeasible reasoning is also a kind of 
						   		ampliative reasoning because its conclusions reach beyond the pure meanings of 
						   		the premises.
						   <br>
						   <br>
						   <p>
						   		The differences between these kinds of reasoning correspond to differences 
						   		about the conditional that each kind of reasoning uses, and on what premise 
						   		(or on what authority) the conditional is adopted:
						   </p>
						   <ul>
							   	<li>
							   		Deductive (from meaning postulate, axiom, or contingent assertion): if p then 
							   		q (i.e., q or not-p)
							   	</li>
							   	<li>
							   		Defeasible (from authority): if p then (defeasibly) q
							   	</li>
							   	<li>
							   		Probabilistic (from combinatorics and indifference): if p then (probably) q
							   	</li>
							   	<li>
							   		Statistical (from data and presumption): the frequency of qs among ps is high
							   		(or inference from a model fit to data); hence, (in the right context) if p 
							   		then (probably) q
							   	</li>
							   	<li>
							   		Inductive (theory formation; from data, coherence, simplicity, and confirmation)
							   		: (inducibly) "if p then q"; hence, if p then (deducibly-but-revisably) q
							   	</li>
							   	<li>
							   		Abductive (from data and theory): p and q are correlated, and q is sufficient for 
							   		p; hence, if p then (abducibly) q as cause
							   	</li>
						   </ul>
						   <p>
						   		Some have thought that defeasible reasoning could be connected to qualitative 
						   		probabilistic reasoning, but such efforts have not borne great insights.</p>
						   <p>
						   		Defeasible reasoning finds its fullest expression in jurisprudence, ethics and 
						   		moral philosophy, epistemology, pragmatics and conversational conventions in 
						   		linguistics, constructivist decision <br>
						   		theories, and in knowledge representation and planning in artificial intelligence. 
						   		It is also closely identified with prima facie (presumptive) reasoning (i.e., 
						   		reasoning on the "face" of evidence), and <br>
						   		ceteris paribus (default) reasoning (i.e., reasoning, all things "being equal").

							<h2>History</h2>
							<p>
								Though Aristotle differentiated the forms of reasoning that are valid for logic 
								and philosophy from the more general ones that are used in everyday life
								(see dialectics and rhetoric), 20th century philosophers mainly concentrated on
								deductive reasoning. At the end of the 19th century, logic texts would typically 
								survey both demonstrative and non-demonstrative reasoning, often giving more space 
								to the latter. However, after the blossoming of mathematical logic at the hands of
								Bertrand Russell, Alfred North Whitehead and Willard van Orman Quine, latter-20th
								century logic texts paid little attention to the non-deductive modes of 
								inference.
							</p>
							<p>
								There are several notable exceptions. John Maynard Keynes wrote his dissertation 
								on non-demonstrative reasoning, and influenced the thinking of Ludwig Wittgenstein 
								on this subject. Wittgenstein, in turn, had many admirers, including the positivist 
								legal scholar H.L.A. Hart and the speech act linguist John L. Austin, Stephen 
								Toulmin in rhetoric (Chaim Perelman too), the moral theorists W.D. Ross and C.L. 
								Stevenson, and the vagueness epistemologist/ontologist Friedrich Waismann.
							</p>
							<p>
								The etymology of defeasible usually refers to Middle English law of contracts, 
								where a condition of defeasance is a clause that can invalidate or annul a contract 
								or deed. Though defeat, dominate, defer, defy, deprecate and derogate are often 
								used in the same contexts as defeasible, the verbs annul and invalidate (and 
								nullify, overturn, rescind, vacate, repeal, debar, void, cancel, countermand, 
								preempt, etc.) are more properly correlated with the concept of defeasibility 
								than those words beginning with the letter d. Many dictionaries do contain the 
								verb, to defease with past participle, defeased.
							</p>
							<p>
								Philosophers in moral theory and rhetoric had taken defeasibility largely for 
								granted when American epistemologists rediscovered Wittgenstein's thinking on the 
								subject: John Ladd, Roderick Chisholm, Roderick Firth, Ernest Sosa, Robert Nozick, 
								and John L. Pollock all began writing with new conviction about how appearance as 
								red was only a defeasible reason for believing something to be red. More importantly 
								Wittgenstein's orientation toward language-games (and away from semantics) 
								emboldened these epistemologists to manage rather than to expurgate prima facie 
								logical inconsistency.
							</p>
							<p>
								At the same time (in the mid-1960s), two more students of Hart and Austin at Oxford, 
								Brian Barry and David Gauthier, were applying defeasible reasoning to political 
								argument and practical reasoning (of action), respectively. Joel Feinberg and Joseph 
								Raz were beginning to produce equally mature works in ethics and jurisprudence 
								informed by defeasibility.
							</p>
							<p>
								By far the most significant works on defeasibility by the mid-1970s were in 
								epistemology, where John Pollock's 1974 Knowledge and Justification popularized 
								his terminology of undercutting and rebutting (which mirrored the analysis of 
								Toulmin). Pollock's work was significant precisely because it brought defeasibility 
								so close to philosophical logicians. The failure of logicians to dismiss 
								defeasibility in epistemology (as Cambridge's logicians had done to Hart decades 
								earlier) landed defeasible reasoning in the philosophical mainstream.
							</p>
							<p>
								Defeasibility had always been closely related to argument, rhetoric, and law, except 
								in epistemology, where the chains of reasons, and the origin of reasons, were not 
								often discussed. Nicholas Rescher's Dialectics is an example of how difficult it was 
								for philosophers to contemplate more complex systems of defeasible reasoning. 
								This was in part because proponents of informal logic became the keepers of argument 
								and rhetoric while insisting that formalism was anathema to argument.
							</p>
							<p>
								About this time, researchers in artificial intelligence became interested in 
								non-monotonic reasoning and its semantics. With philosophers such as Pollock and 
								Donald Nute (e.g., defeasible logic), dozens of computer scientists and logicians 
								produced complex systems of defeasible reasoning between 1980 and 2000. No single 
								system of defeasible reasoning would emerge in the same way that Quine's system of 
								logic became a de facto standard. Nevertheless, the 100-year headstart on 
								non-demonstrative logical calculi, due to George Boole, Charles Sanders Peirce, 
								and Gottlob Frege was being closed: both demonstrative and non-demonstrative 
								reasoning now have formal calculi.
							</p>
							<p>
								There are related (and slightly competing) systems of reasoning that are newer 
								than systems of defeasible reasoning, e.g., belief revision and dynamic logic. 
								The dialogue logics of Charles Hamblin and Jim Mackenzie (logician), and their 
								colleagues, can also be tied closely to defeasible reasoning. Belief revision 
								is a non-constructive specification of the desiderata with which, or constraints 
								according to which, epistemic change takes place. Dynamic logic is related mainly 
								because, like paraconsistent logic, the reordering of premises can change the set 
								of justified conclusions. Dialogue logics introduce an adversary, but are like 
								belief revision theories in their adherence to deductively consistent states of 
								belief.
